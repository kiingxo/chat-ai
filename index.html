To address the security issue with the API token in your project, it's crucial to ensure that the token is not exposed in the client-side code, such as in `index.html`. Instead, the token should be securely stored on the server-side and accessed through server-side code. Since the `index.html` file doesn't contain any JavaScript or API token directly, I assume the token might be included in a JavaScript file or inline script not shown here. Here's a general approach to secure the API token:

1. **Move API Token to Server-Side**: Ensure the API token is stored on the server-side, not in the client-side code.
2. **Create a Secure Endpoint**: Implement a server-side endpoint that handles requests requiring the API token.
3. **Use Environment Variables**: Store the API token in environment variables on the server to prevent exposure in the codebase.

Here's a conceptual code diff to illustrate moving the token handling to the server-side:

```diff
- // Example of client-side code where API token might be exposed
- const apiToken = 'YOUR_API_TOKEN'; // Remove this from client-side

+ // Server-side code (e.g., Node.js/Express)
+ const express = require('express');
+ const app = express();
+ const fetch = require('node-fetch');
+ require('dotenv').config(); // Use dotenv to manage environment variables

+ const API_TOKEN = process.env.API_TOKEN; // Store token in environment variable

+ app.get('/api/data', async (req, res) => {
+     try {
+         const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
+             headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_TOKEN}` }
+         });
+         const data = await response.json();
+         res.json(data);
+     } catch (error) {
+         res.status(500).send('Error fetching data');
+     }
+ });

+ app.listen(3000, () => {
+     console.log('Server running on port 3000');
+ });
```

**Summary**: The API token should be moved to the server-side and accessed through a secure endpoint. Use environment variables to manage sensitive information like API tokens. This approach prevents the token from being exposed in the client-side code.
